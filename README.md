# PyBer weekly fare analysis.
## Over view of the project.
### After analyizing PyBer data based on city, city type, the number of driver in each PyBer city and total fare of each city. We started to understand better on PyBer's market, revenue distribution and capacity for those locations. To answer the question of what will those metrics be in the future and what decision should we make to robust PerBer's business, we need to summary those date and aggregate the date information to the trend of PerBer's operation.

### * 1 From january 2019 to end of apri, the total rides for rural city is just 125, there are several date, there is rides at all, PyBer could try to advertise more to get more driver.  
### * 2 In the first 4 month of 2019, the rides is too stable which means that either the market is full for PyBer or the marketing department should put more resource to develop business. 
### * 3 the average fare per driver is way too high for rural driver compare the fare per driver for suburban and urban, PyBer should try to lower it.
